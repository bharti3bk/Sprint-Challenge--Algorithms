#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
O(n) because it will be iterating in a single loop

b)
O(n^2) because nested loops

c)
O(1) because all that's done is a comparison

## Exercise II
If n is less than f return n, else return f - 1

O(1) because its just a comparison
